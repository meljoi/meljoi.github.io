    <h1>Welcome to my Playground!</h1>
    <p>New York is known as the city that never sleeps and rightly so. There is always something to do day or night and I’m here to tell you about a few. I think we as New Yorkers don’t take full advantage of what is offered here. There are people who visit from different parts of the US and world that know more about what goes on here than we do. We gotta do better! And I am not just talking about Manhattan but all five boroughs.  <em>Spots</em> was created for New Yorkers by New Yorkers to be able to explore our beloved city. So come take the journey with me!</p>
